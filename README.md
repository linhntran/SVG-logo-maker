# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This week's challenge allows us to utilize our skills to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a logo and saves it as an SVG file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application prompts the user to select a text, text color, shape and shape color. 

The application will also use Jest for running a unit test to check the render() method using a given shape color. 

The following walkthrough video demonstrates the functionality of the SVG logo maker. The video shows how a user would invoke the application from the command line and how they would enter responses to all of the prompts. In the end of the video, a simple SVG logo is presented.

To install inquier, please use `npm i inquirer@8.2.4` in the command line. The application can then be initialized using the `node index.js` command. 

The user will also need to make sure they have Jest package installed. Visit the following link for more information. [Jest Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)

## Usage

Once all technologies listed in the Installation section above have been installed, simply invoke the application by using the `node index.js` command to get your SVG logo created.
